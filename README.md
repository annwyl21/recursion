# Recursion & Graphviz

A repo to explore recursion using a real world example; a task list and a time limit, while learning to use Graphviz.

### Why does housework seem to take an eternity? 
Well, it's not just about the cleaning and tidying up! 
- Each chore is like a contestant in a game show of my own making called **'Should I Do This Now?'**. 
- Every task gets its moment on the stage, where I, the illustrious host, must decide: 'Do I tackle this chore now, or 'bank it for later'?' 
- So, you see, it's not _just cleaning_! â€“ it's **strategic planning and time management**. 

## So when I decided to study recursion - household chores were the ideal place to start...

I have 6 minutes and several chores on my task list.
- How can I best use my time? - I need an algorythm to create the choices NOT an algorythm to make the decision for me. 
- And I need those choices displayed visually!

### My Solution
- Use recursion to find the possible options and display them using Graphviz
_Note: This requires Graphviz to be installed._
```
python recursion.py
```
Each time the recursive function is called, the parameters are adjusted to change the starting point, moving closer towards an empty task list.
There are key break points in my recursive cycles, to break the loop when specific conditions are met, either;
- the time limit is reached, or 
- the time limit is exceeded.
My recursion ceases when the starting point reaches an empty list, and I have cycled through all the possible options.
