# Recursion

A repo to explore recursion using a real world example; a task list and a time limit, while learning to use Graphviz.

I have 6 minutes and several tasks on my task list.
How can I best use my time? - I need an algorythm to create the choices not an algorythm to make the decision. And I need those choices displayed visually!

- Use recursion to find the possible options
```
python recursion_tasklist.py
```
- Run the generated graphviz code
```
dot -Tpng outfile.gv -o taskgraph.png
```
_Note: This requires Graphviz to be installed._

Result:
![Task List](./taskgraph.png)

IDEA for a 'what to do app': 
- make better use of your 15mins faffing around time
- I have 20 minutes and I want to have a cup of tea
- It takes 2-minutes for the kettle to boil for a cuppa, how can I fill that time
